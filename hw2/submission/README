To run KNNTests and LogRegTests, set these variables to True at the beginning of the main function.

For KNNTests I call run(load,dataName) to run each dataset. Prints out dataset name, training and testing losses.
I pass in the corresponding load dataset function to run each time.
I used max_k to set the max k to run to for KNN. There's a few of these. The uncommented out one is the sqrt of the training set's length. I set the max_k manually for a few of the runs to get graphs that looked better.

For LogRegTests I call LogReg(load,dataName,multiclass) to run each dataset. Prints out dataset name, scores. 
I pass in the corresponding load dataset function to run each time.

I saved my numpy arrays for KNN for some reason but it's commented out.
I also save the matplotlib plots within run(...) for KNN. 
There are comments next to my implementations of other functions to detail what I'm doing each line.
